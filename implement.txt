instructions

Required libs: matplotlib, lmdb via pip install matplotlib, pip install lmdb

There are 4 total files in regard to training vanilla GAN and DCGAN.
1. Data preprocess & load (data.py): includes converting mdb file to .wedp.
Also has an option to train images as RGB or greyscale(standarized)
2. Model implementation (gan.py <- generator.py / discriminator.py)
3. Training (train.py)
4. Inference (test.py)

In order to run training via command refer to instructions below
parameters
1. --DATA_DIR, required=True, type=str: provide path of your dataset, specific to location of mdb file
2. --BATCH_SIZE, required=False, type=int, default=100
3. --TYPE, required=False, type=str, default='vanilla': provide which model you would like to train, options={'vanilla', 'dc'}
example) python3 train.py --DATA_DIR /Users/workspace/lsun/church --BATCH_SIZE 100 --TYPE vanilla

* If you can't find the converted .wedp files in data folder, please delete the data folder and rerun the train.py


To test trained model, run Python3 test.py --TYPE 'vanilla'
Make sure you test the trained model type.
1. --TYPE, required=False, type=str, default='vanilla': provide which model you would like to train, options={'vanilla', 'dc'}
*Due to test.py you are required to install matplotlib
